            <h2><b>Why</b></h2>
            <p>Embarrasing baggage checks at TSA? Lost essentail items which were not allowed on the flight? We all have those moments. Our team faced the same problems, and we decided to build a platform that addresses this exact problem </p>

            <h2><b>How</b></h2>
            <p>We used a combination of computer vision using transfer learning, natural language processing, and soft cosine similarity. MobileNet gave us top 5 predictions, which were tested using cosine similarity to a hard-coded list of prohibited items</p>
